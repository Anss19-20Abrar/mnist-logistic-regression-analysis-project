# mnist-logistic-regression-analysis-project
MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification
This repository contains code and analysis for a data mining project focused on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The project involves using logistic regression to classify digits and analyzing the model's performance.

Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the MNIST dataset, which consists of 55,000 handwritten digit images. We are using logistic regression for binary classification between two different digits. The primary focus is on understanding how logistic regression works in the context of digit recognition.
